## Elements

To create a document, you need to create a JSON file that describes the document. The JSON file is composed of elements. Each element has a type and a set of properties. The type is used to determine which element to use, and the properties are used to configure the element.

See the [Elements](/docs/elements/README.md) page for a list of all available elements.
