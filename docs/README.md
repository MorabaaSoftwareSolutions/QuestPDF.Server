# QuestPDF Server Docs

QuestPDF Server is an open-source API server that allows you to generate PDF documents using a simple JSON-based API.

It's powered by [QuestPDF](https://github.com/QuestPDF/QuestPDF), a .NET library that allows you to create PDF documents using a fluent API.

## Elements

To create a document, you need to create a JSON file that describes the document. The JSON file is composed of elements. Each element has a type and a set of properties. The type is used to determine which element to use, and the properties are used to configure the element.

See the [Elements](/docs/elements/README.md) page for a list of all available elements.
